# Low Notification Volume Fix for Nexus 6 (7.1.1)
Applies a patched version of `audio_effects.conf` with specific lines commented out as per a [thread created by fjsferreira on XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/general/guide-tentative-fix-messenger-whatsapp-t3272992). It fixes notification sounds starting at a low volume instead of playing at the loudness they should.
